# Diabetes Classification using Ensemble Methods
This code uses ensemble methods (bagging and random forests) to classify a dataset of patients into those who have diabetes and those who do not.

**Dataset**
The dataset used is called diabetes.csv and contains 768 rows and 9 columns. The columns are:

Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Outcome (0 or 1)
There are no missing values in the dataset.

**Preprocessing**
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection. The feature values are then standardized using StandardScaler() from sklearn.preprocessing.

**Model**
Two ensemble methods are used: bagging and random forests. In both cases, the base estimator is a decision tree classifier.

**Evaluation**
The out-of-bag score and test set accuracy score are computed for the bagging classifier. The 5-fold cross validation scores are computed for both the bagging classifier and the random forest classifier. Finally, the confusion matrix and classification report are computed for the bagging classifier on the testing set.

**Error Analysis**
There is no explicit error analysis in this code. However, the confusion matrix and classification report provide some information about the errors made by the bagging classifier.

**Conclusion**
The bagging classifier achieved a test set accuracy score of 0.78, which is not bad, but there is certainly room for improvement. The random forest classifier achieved a higher average accuracy score of 0.76 with 5-fold cross validation. Overall, these results suggest that ensemble methods can be effective for classification problems like this one.
