Random Forest Classifier on Breast Cancer Dataset
Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset is a binary classification dataset that contains 30 numeric features representing characteristics of cell nuclei, such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness. The target variable is the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).

Algorithm
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

Model Performance
After pre-processing the dataset using MinMaxScaler, selecting the best features using SelectKBest and optimizing the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Classifier using RandomizedSearchCV, the model achieved an F1-score of 0.97 on the test set.

Conclusion
Random Forest Classifier is a powerful machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks like the one on this dataset. The model achieved an F1-score of 0.96 on the test set, which is a good performance. The feature importance plot revealed that worst concave points, worst perimeter and mean concave points are the top three most important features for the classification task.
