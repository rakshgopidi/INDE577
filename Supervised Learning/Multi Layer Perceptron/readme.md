Bank Note Authentication
This code performs bank note authentication using the MLPClassifier algorithm from scikit-learn.

Algorithm
The MLPClassifier algorithm is a multi-layer perceptron classifier that trains using backpropagation. The MLPClassifier has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance, such as the maximum number of iterations, the activation function, the solver, and the number of hidden layers and neurons.

Data
The code reads in a CSV file containing bank note data. The data contains the following features:

Variance of wavelet transformed image (continuous)
Skewness of wavelet transformed image (continuous)
Kurtosis of wavelet transformed image (continuous)
Entropy of image (continuous)
The data also contains a Class column indicating whether the bank note is authentic or not.

Performance analysis
The code performs performance analysis on the trained MLPClassifier model using the following evaluation metrics:

Confusion matrix: a table showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives
Classification report: a summary of precision, recall, F1 score, and support for each class
F2 score: a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, with a higher weight given to recall
The code also performs 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.

Error analysis
The code generates a heatmap of the correlation between the features to identify any strong correlations that could affect the model's performance.
