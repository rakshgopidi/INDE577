Single Layer Perceptron on Breast Cancer Dataset
This code implements a single layer perceptron on the Breast Cancer Dataset available in the scikit-learn library. The goal is to classify tumor samples as either malignant or benign based on the features of the tumor.

Dataset Description
The Breast Cancer Dataset consists of 569 samples with 30 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target variable is binary, with a value of 0 representing malignant and 1 representing benign.

Single Layer Perceptron Description
A single layer perceptron is a neural network model with only one layer of output nodes. The input is passed through a linear transformation followed by a sigmoid activation function to produce the output.

Loss Function and Gradient
The loss function used is binary cross-entropy loss with L2 regularization. The gradient is computed using backpropagation and the chain rule.

Model Description
The code first loads the dataset and splits it into training and testing sets. The features are scaled using StandardScaler. The labels are one-hot encoded using np.zeros function. The weights and bias are initialized using random values. The hyperparameters include learning rate, number of epochs, and regularization parameter. The model is trained using the defined loss function and gradient using the training data. The training and testing loss curves are plotted. Finally, the model is used to make predictions on the test set and the F1 score is calculated using the sklearn.metrics.f1_score function.

Performance Analysis
The model achieved an F1 score of 0.94 on the test set. The training and testing loss curves indicate that the model is not overfitting as the testing loss is not increasing while the training loss is decreasing.

Conclusion
A single layer perceptron can achieve good performance on the breast cancer dataset. However, it may not be suitable for more complex datasets where a deep neural network may be required. Regularization is important to prevent overfitting of the model.
