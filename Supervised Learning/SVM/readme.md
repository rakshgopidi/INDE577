# Support Vector Machine:
**Dataset description**
The dataset used in this code is "Social_Network_Ads.csv". It contains information about customers of a certain company including their age, gender, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a particular product or not.

**Preprocessing**
The dataset is preprocessed using the following steps:

Importing the necessary libraries.
Reading the csv file using pandas.
Separating the features and the target variable.
Splitting the dataset into the training set and test set.
Scaling the features using StandardScaler.

**Model description**
A support vector machine (SVM) is used in this code to classify whether a customer will purchase the product or not. The SVM algorithm seeks to find the hyperplane that best separates the two classes in the dataset. In this code, a linear kernel is used to find the hyperplane.

**Training and testing**
The code trains the SVM classifier on the training set and then predicts the labels of the test set using the trained classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using several metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Performance evaluation**
The performance of the classifier is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: It measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.
Precision: It measures the proportion of true positives out of the total instances predicted as positive.
Recall: It measures the proportion of true positives out of the total instances that are actually positive.
F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
A confusion matrix is also used to visualize the performance of the classifier.

**Conclusion**
The SVM classifier with a linear kernel performs well on the given dataset with an accuracy of 90%. However, to improve the performance of the classifier, we can try different kernels and hyperparameters of the SVM algorithm.
