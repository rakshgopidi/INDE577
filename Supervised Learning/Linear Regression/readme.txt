This README file provides an overview of the code provided in the script. The code performs linear regression on the Boston Housing dataset.

1. Importing Libraries
The necessary libraries are imported, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn modules for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and modeling.

2. Loading and Preparing the Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's load_boston() function. The dataset is then converted to a pandas DataFrame, and null values are checked using the isnull().sum() function. Unnecessary columns ('ZN', 'NOX', 'INDUS') are dropped, and one-hot encoding is applied to the 'CHAS' feature using pd.get_dummies(). Null values in the DataFrame are filled with the median value using fillna().

3. Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix is calculated for the features in the DataFrame using the corr() function. A heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix is created using seaborn's heatmap() function.

4. Feature Extraction and Preprocessing
The input features and target variable are extracted from the DataFrame. The input features are scaled using StandardScaler() from scikit-learn. Polynomial features of degree 2 are created using PolynomialFeatures().

5. Data Splitting
The data is split into training and test sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn.

6. Model Training
A linear regression model is trained on the training set using LinearRegression().

7. Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set by predicting the target variable using the trained model. Mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2) values are calculated using scikit-learn's mean_squared_error() and r2_score() functions.

8. Visualization
A scatter plot is created to visualize the actual vs predicted values of the target variable.
