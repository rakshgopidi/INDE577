# Rice-INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning
This repository is created by Rakshith Reddy, a graduate student in Engineering Management and Leadership at Rice University. This repository is for code assignments of course INDE577, Data Science and Machine Learning, of Rice University in Spring 2023. In this course, we are learning data science and machine learning algorithms and python-based applications. Course topics consist of Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

This course has equipped me with the necessary knowledge and tools to implement machine learning algorithms that learn from data. It covers a wide range of techniques, from basic to advanced, including deep learning, and emphasizes the importance of data preparation and the use of popular machine learning libraries.Overall, this course provides a practical and comprehensive introduction to machine learning for real-world applications.
